pando is a remote protocol for `git` repositories enforcing [DAO-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) versioning, contribution tracking and governance. It is built on top of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [aragonOS](https://aragon.one/os).

This repository is a monorepo including all pando-related smart contracts, apps and CLI tools. Each public sub-package is independently published to NPM.

### Why pando ?

Pando [Latin for "spread out"] is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant occupies 43 hectares and is estimated to weigh collectively 6.000.000 kilograms, making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80.000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.
